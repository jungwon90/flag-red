## Project Proposal

### Why do we need Flag Red?

Since 1970, wildfires frequency in U.S. has increased by 400%. 
There has not been a month without wildfires since 2012. 
Woolsey fire burned 97,000 acres destroying 1,600 buildings and 
forcing 81,000 people to evacuate their homes.

### Overview

Wild Fire Monitoring Service with air quality/pollution.

The app makes the users aware of active fires at all times.

It  informs your users of nearby active fires with the pollution increase 
in the air surrounding them.

It also inform your users of the seasonal and locational increase in air pollution 
caused by fires and advise them on the safest places outdoors for a run or even to walk their dog.



### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

Fire data API from ambee. Air quality API from ambee.

Python, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Flask, Jinja, React, Bootstrap



### Data

Ambee fire API, air quality API, Google Maps API.



### Roadmap

#### MVP

- If the user doesn't type any city or region, the User can see 
the whole active fire situcation in the U.S.
